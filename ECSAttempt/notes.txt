NOTES

Bugs:
* Currently if you instantiate at the start before Load such as spritesystem then it loads twice, 
once for instantiate and then when it gets to load part of state then again. 
This can cause Content.Load such as images to load twice unnecessarily.

ECS:
* Check if duplicate components, warn and stop if entity has component already that is being added
* Use an event system for notifying about adding/removal of components and what systems may or may not be interested in that entity as a result
* Should not instantiate entities in GameState Initialize
